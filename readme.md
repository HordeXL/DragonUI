## Notes

This addon is a work in progress and may contain bugs. I'm working on it alone while still learning, so some parts of the code might look a bit wild, but that's the plan: to improve it over time.

If you're interested in helping develop or improve it, contributions are welcome! There's definitely room for optimization and fixes.

## Known Issues

- **Vehicle & Party UI Bugs:** Action bars, unit frames, and party frames may break, move, or display incorrectly when entering vehicles. All vehicle-related UI behavior still needs to be fixed.
- Other bugs are still present and will be polished over time.

## Credits

This project combines and adapts code from several sources:

- **[s0h2x](https://github.com/s0h2x)** – Two specific addons: one for action bars and another for minimap, which have been merged and integrated into DragonUI.
- **[KarlHeinz_Schneider - Dragonflight UI (Classic)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dragonflight-ui-classic)** – Original addon from which many elements have been taken and backported/adapted to 3.3.5a, including the micro menu and other features built from scratch based on this design.
- **[Raz0r1337 - RetailUI](https://github.com/Raz0r1337/RetailUI)** – Large portions of code are used as reference and directly integrated for UI elements and implementation approaches.
